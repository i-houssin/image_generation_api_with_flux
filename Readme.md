![Generated Image](/teamspace/studios/this_studio/output-2025-02-28 17:19:40.370827.png)

## 🌟 Overview
Deploy an image generation API with Flux and LitServe. Transform text prompts into stunning AI-generated images effortlessly! 🎨✨

This project enables users to generate images from textual prompts using **Flux**, an open-source text-to-image model. It deploys a **private API** powered by **LitServe**, a high-performance AI inference engine. 

## 🔥 Features
✅ **Serverless** (scale to zero)  
✅ **Private API** 🔒  
✅ **Your own infrastructure** 🏗️  
✅ **Multi-GPU support** 🚀  

## 🧠 Background
### 🎭 Flux
Flux is an **open-source, large-scale text-to-image generation model** developed by **Black Forest Labs**. This project utilizes the **Flux Schnell** checkpoint, licensed under **Apache**.

### ⚡ LitServe
LitServe is a **scalable** AI inference engine providing a **lightweight** and **efficient** interface for deploying AI models.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 🔹 Step 0: Setup Environment
The studio comes **preconfigured** with all necessary dependencies, checkpoints, and code. Just **plug & play!** ⚡

### 🔹 Step 1: Start the Server
Run the server in a terminal to **kickstart** image generation requests. 🖥️💨

### 🔹 Step 2: Use the API
Send prompts and receive **high-quality** AI-generated images in response. 📩🖼️

### 🔹 Step 3: Expose the Server
Share your API with the world 🌍 by exposing it via **tunneling services** or cloud deployment. ☁️

### 🔹 Step 4: Enable Serverless Deployment
Optimize resource usage by enabling **auto-start** on your endpoint. 🛠️🚦

### 🔹 Step 5: Scale Performance
Enhance performance using **batching**, **multi-GPU processing**, and more **LitServe** optimizations. 🚀🔧

## 🎯 Conclusion
This project provides a streamlined method for deploying a **powerful, scalable image-generation API** using Flux and LitServe. With the right optimizations, it can be **production-ready** for any AI-driven application. 🚀💡
